        Design Decisions: We decided as a group that there still needed to be some more interactive visuals that told users more about the data in comparison to others. 
        We felt that for each subcategory we needed an associate graph or table to show data in relations to others. We also wanted to make navigating through this site easier
        if there were many buildings being used. A final idea that we had was a good Summary page, since often times the managers wouldn't need too indepth data unless there was a problem
        but rather a 'Summary' page to inform them that everything is normal. For these reasonse we had small blocks representing any data on usage of differnet utilities and
        made sure that there were options for mulitple buildings. We also added a tips page as this could be a customizable set of tips that Cambio can provide based on the 
        building data.

    <ul>
        <li>Be clear about color distinctions (ex. red if some tenants are using substantially higher usage compared to other tenants)</li>
        <li>The summary page is pushed towards the bottom but data from the summary page could be put into graphs or charts on the home page</li>
        <li>Switch up the fonts (currently only one font throughout)</li>
        <li>“Book Here”/“Consultation” should be on the home page or more showcased than at the bottom of the summary page</li>
        <li>Perhaps the summary page should even be the main page</li>
        <li>Group all of the data related to different components to show the cost vs emissions data in one spot</li>
        <li>On iPhone/tablet - size wise boxes are too small (specifically on the summary page)</li>
        <li>Introduce different information between the summary and home pages</li>
        <li>Cost Analysis button could be a different shape to distinguish it from others</li>
